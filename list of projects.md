# Where the Countryside Thrives: A Domestic Guide for Rural Renewal

2025

*short*

A design proposal reimagining rural life in Northern China. This project explores how architecture can support new ways of living, working, and sharing space in a changing countryside.

*long*

*Where the Countryside Thrives* is an architectural design project set in Shuiyu Village, Northern China. It responds to the fading of traditional village life and asks: what might a new kind of rural living look like today?

Rather than seeing the countryside as a place left behind, this proposal imagines it as a site of innovation—where former villagers, city migrants, and new livelihoods intersect. The design introduces domestic-scale interventions that support both urban remote work and local engagement, weaving private life and public exchange together.

Through housing, shared courtyards, and flexible spaces, Homegrown Futures offers a spatial framework for collaboration, negotiation, and care. It’s not a nostalgic return, but a forward-looking idea of how architecture can help the countryside thrive again.

1 Remaking Shuiyu
The design reshapes the village’s topography to mediate between the tower block, old homes, and farmland. Stone ruins become shared agricultural amenities, and a new viewing slope reconnects the village with its mountainous backdrop.

2 Village Centres
Three key public spaces anchor community life: a convenience store and nursery at the village entrance, a revitalised theatre stage for performances and dancing, and a waterside wash-and-weave pavilion. These hubs support both everyday routines and social gathering.
 
3 Two Households
Stories of two hybrid households reveal the frictions and negotiations of shared living: one family returns from the city to raise a child, while another home becomes a semi-informal co-living setup between a landlady and two urban youths.

4 The Great Return
A speculative comic and schematic plans depict the process of urban return. Modular appliance towers enable flexible domesticity, while shared amenities and altered property lines support both autonomy and embeddedness in a shifting rural landscape.

# Shuiyu Unscripted: Life Drawn from a Northern Village

2024-2025

*short*

A hand-drawn series capturing real moments from daily life in a rural Chinese village. These sketches observe humour, hardship, and community through an honest, personal lens.

*long*

Shuiyu Unscripted is a visual storytelling project made up of black-and-white sketches and graphic vignettes, based on real-life observations in Shuiyu Village. It captures everyday moments often overlooked: the messiness of winter showers, the quiet politics of mahjong tables, suspicious glances from village aunties.

Drawn from lived experience, these studies reflect a village in flux—shaped by ageing populations, neglected infrastructure, and deep-rooted social ties. They are not idealised images, but honest ones: sometimes absurd, sometimes tender, always grounded in reality.

Through this series, drawing becomes a way to document a disappearing way of life and to reflect on the resilience that remains in ordinary routines.

# The Mapless Village: Collaging Memory and Change

2024

*short*

A visual series of sixteen collages exploring how one rural village in China is being transformed by urban-style development. The work contrasts official plans with the way villagers actually live and remember their environment.

*long*

The Mapless Village is a series of sixteen collages that trace the transformation of Shuiyu, a small rural village in Northern China, as it faces the impact of new high-rise development. The series is structured around four chapters and questions how space is understood and navigated—from the perspective of top-down planners versus that of local villagers.

Rather than following maps or masterplans, villagers orient themselves through memory, relationships, and everyday landmarks—like a courtyard, a chicken coop, or a funeral banner. These familiar cues now sit in tension with the rigid repetition of a new apartment block that disrupts the village’s rhythms and identity.

Drawing on mapping ideas by James Corner and Ozayr Saloojee, the collages challenge the authority of conventional maps and architectural order. Instead, they offer a more intimate form of mapping—one that values lived experience, resists erasure, and reclaims space as something deeply personal.

# Our Book of Hope

2021

A 36-page picture book created in collaboration with writer Foo Choon Ean, based on her poem about living with obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD). The poem, written as a form of personal expression and catharsis, narrates the rhythms of a mind negotiating fear, order, and exhaustion. Visualised through simple, emotionally resonant illustrations, the book gives form to the interior experience of OCD—without diagnosis or explanation. Originally featured in the Mental Health Collective SG Exhibition (2021), this work is a testament to the healing power of words, images, and shared understanding.

# Creature Comfort

2019

A collaborative photography project with Rebecca Leung and Bob Shi. Together, we built a life-sized papier-mâché head and took it on a journey through Singapore’s everyday spaces. Worn and performed by me, the oversized head becomes a gentle, awkward intruder—playing claw machines, sitting alone at hawker centres, waiting at traffic lights. Part absurd, part tender, the project reflects on visibility, vulnerability, and the quiet comedy of public life.

# The Cat Lady

2018

A quietly surreal picture book about an elderly woman who lives alone with a black cat. Isolated but not invisible, she eventually begins to meow—softly at first, then constantly—blurring the line between human and animal. The night she dies, cats from the neighbourhood wail into the darkness. By morning, the street is silent, washed in sunlight. This short tale explores loneliness, transformation, and the small mysteries we leave behind.
